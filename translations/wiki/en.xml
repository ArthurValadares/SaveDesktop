  <str key="synchronization_intro">In addition to saving the configuration and importing it, SaveDesktop also allows you to synchronize it between computers on your network using a shared cloud folder or a shared Syncthing folder.</str>
  <str key="set_up_first_pc">## Setting Up on the First Computer
1. Open the **Sync** page in the SaveDesktop app.
2. Click **“Set up the sync file.”**
3. A quick setup wizard will appear:
   * If you're using GNOME, Cinnamon, Budgie, or older COSMIC, the **GNOME Online Accounts** method is used.
   * For KDE Plasma or other desktops, it switches to **Rclone** (you’ll just need to copy a command and paste it into the terminal).
   * Alternatively, you can use **Syncthing** by clicking **“Use Syncthing’s folder instead”** and selecting a synced folder.
4. After finishing the wizard, the **“Set up the sync file”** dialog will open:
   * A **periodic saving file** (your desktop config archive) will start generating inside the selected folder.
   * You can optionally change the interval or filename using the **“Change”** button.
5. Click **“Apply”**:
   * A second file, `SaveDesktop.json`, is created in the same folder. It contains the sync file name and saving interval.
   * You will be prompted to **log out** of your session so synchronization can fully activate.</str>
  <str key="set_up_second_pc">## Connecting on Another Computer
1. On the other computer, go to the **Sync** page again.
2. Click **“Connect to the cloud storage.”**
3. The same wizard will appear – choose your synced folder via GNOME OA, Rclone, or Syncthing.
4. After the wizard:
   * The **“Connect to the cloud storage”** dialog opens.
   * Select the **sync interval** and enable or disable **Bidirectional synchronization**.
5. Click **“Apply”**:
   * You will be prompted to **log out**, or (if using manual sync) informed that you can sync from the app’s header menu.
   * After logging back in, SaveDesktop connects to the shared folder and syncs your configuration automatically, with a notification at the start and end.

  <str key="bidirectional_sync">### Bidirectional Synchronization
If **Bidirectional synchronization** is enabled on both computers:
* SaveDesktop copies sync settings (such as interval and filename) from one machine to the other,
* This keeps your systems in sync without needing to configure each one manually.</str>
  <str key="synchronization_files">## Files Used in Synchronization
* **Periodic saving file** – a `.sd.zip` archive of your desktop configuration, updated regularly.
* **SaveDesktop.json** – a small helper file that stores the archive’s filename and saving interval, used during sync setup.</str>
  <str key="saving_cfg_title">Saving configuration</str>
  <str key="version_warning">**This feature is available from version: `3.2.2`**</str>
  <str key="saving_cfg_intro">If you prefer command-line interface (CLI) before graphical user interface (GUI), SaveDesktop in addition to saving configuration in the GUI, allows you save configuration in the CLI.</str>
  <str key="save_cfg_outro">When using this method, it uses parameters from the GUI, specifically parameters from the periodic saving mode, such as filename format and selected folder for periodic saving files. You can save the configuration with this method whenever you want, regardless of the selected periodic saving interval.</str>
  <str key="import_cfg_in_cli_title">Importing configuration</str>
  <str key="imp_cfg_cli_intro">In addition to importing configuration in the GUI, SaveDesktop also allows you to import configuration in the command line interface (CLI), which you can use in case your desktop environment breaks.</str>
  <str key="imp_cfg_cli_steps">### So how to proceed?
**1. Open a terminal**

You can open it from the applications menu, or by using the Ctrl+Alt+T keyboard shortcut.

**2. Enter the command**

Enter the following command in the terminal:
- if you have SaveDesktop installed as a Flatpak package, use the following:
     ```
     flatpak run io.github.vikdevelop.SaveDesktop --import-config /path/to/filename.sd.tar.gz
     ```
- if you have SaveDesktop installed as a Snap or native package, use: 
     ```
     savedesktop --import-config /path/to/filename.sd.tar.gz
     ```</str>
  <str key="imp_cfg_cli_note">**Note**:
- instead of `/path/to/filename.sd.tar.gz`, enter the path to the configuration archive you want to import, for example: `/home/user/Downloads/myconfig.sd.tar.gz`</str>

  <str key="periodic_saving">Sauvegardes régulières</str>
  <str key="pb_desc">En plus des sauvegardes manuelles, SaveDesktop vous permets aussi de sauvegarder la configuration de votre bureau de façon périodique. Vous pouvez choisir parmi les options suivantes:</str>
  <str key="pb_options">- **Daily**: 
  - After logging into the system, SaveDesktop starts in the background and backs up the configuration. If you then log back in this day, it will not do it again, because it has already been created for that day.
- **Weekly**:
  - SaveDesktop performs a configuration backup every Monday if "Weekly" is selected. If the computer is not running on that day, SaveDesktop does not do it the next day.
- **Monthly**:
  - If "Monthly" is selected, SaveDesktop makes the backup on the first day of the month, e.g. May 1, June 1, December 1, etc. As with "Weekly", if the computer is not running on that day, SaveDesktop does not perform it the next day.
- **Never**:
  - Nothing's happening</str>
  <str key="pb_location">### Where are the periodic saving files stored?
Default directory for periodic saving is `/home/user/Downloads/SaveDesktop/archives`, but you can choose custom directory.</str>
  <str key="pb_filename_title">### Filename format</str>
  <str key="pb_filname_desc">If you want to give periodic backup files names other than `config_{}`, you can set the filename format.
The default name, as already mentioned, is `config_{}`. `{}` is a variable in SaveDesktop that sets the today date. If it's not there and the day of backup creation comes and a backup file with the filename format set by your filename format exists, SaveDesktop overwrites it with the new backup file. Otherwise, SaveDesktop creates a new backup file.</str>
  <str key="synchronization_between_computers_title">Synchronization between computers in the network</str>
  <str key="periodic_sync">## Periodic synchronization
You can choose between the following items:
- Daily
- Weekly (synchronization takes place every Tuesday)
- Monthly (synchronization takes place every second day in the month)
- Manually (it is possible to sync configuration from the menu in the header bar by clicking on the three dots)
- Never (nothing's happening)</str>
  <str key="save_installed_flatpaks_title">Save installed Flatpak apps and install it from list</str>
  <str key="save_flatpak_intro">Since version 2.5, SaveDesktop allows you to save installed Flatpak applications and install them from a list. So how does it work?</str>
  <str key="saving_flatpaks">### Saving installed Flatpak applications
It is only possible to save a list of Flatpak applications installed in the system directory `/var/lib/flatpak/app`, not in the home directory `~/.local/share/flatpak/app`. In the saved configuration archive, the list of installed Flatpak applications is labeled as `installed_flatpaks.sh`.</str>
  <str key="installing_flatpaks">### Installing Flatpak applications from the list
After importing the saved configuration file and logging back in, **the Flatpak applications will start installing in the background.**</str>
  <str key="version_warning">**This feature is available from version: `3.2.2`**</str>
  <str key="import_cfg_in_cli_title">Importing configuration</str>
  <str key="imp_cfg_cli_intro">In addition to importing configuration in the GUI, SaveDesktop also allows you to import configuration in the command line interface (CLI), which you can use in case your desktop environment breaks.</str>
  <str key="imp_cfg_cli_steps">### So how to proceed?
**1. Open a terminal**

You can open it from the applications menu, or by using the Ctrl+Alt+T keyboard shortcut.

**2. Type the command to import the configuration**

Enter the following command in the terminal:
- if you have SaveDesktop installed as a Flatpak package, use the following:

     ```
     flatpak run io.github.vikdevelop.SaveDesktop --import-config /path/to/filename.sd.tar.gz
     ```

- if you have SaveDesktop installed as a Snap or native package, use: 
     ```
     savedesktop --import-config /path/to/filename.sd.tar.gz
     ```</str>
  <str key="imp_cfg_cli_note">**Note**:
- instead of `/path/to/filename.sd.tar.gz`, enter the path to the configuration archive you want to import, for example: `/home/user/Downloads/myconfig.sd.tar.gz`</str>
  <str key="archive_encryption_">Archive encryption</str>
  <str key="archive_encryption_desc">If you want to encrypt the configuration archive, whether for data protection reasons or something else, you can use the archive encryption feature in the SaveDesktop app. So, how does it work, and how to set it up?</str>
  <str key="ac_intro">## How does it work?
If this feature is enabled, SaveDesktop will always ask you to create a password for your new archive of the configuration. The criteria for the password include at least 12 characters, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special character. If the password doesn't meet these criteria, it will not be possible to continue saving configuration. </str>
  <str key="ac_warn">&amp;gt; [!WARNING]  
&amp;gt; The periodic saving files are (so far) not available to protect with a password. Encrypted archives are, so far, not possible to use in synchronization.</str>
  <str key="ac_setup">## How to set it up?
In the 3.3 version, the interface has been slightly modified, specifically, periodic saving section is now located under the "More options" button. On the same place, is located archive encryption section. So click on the already mentioned button, and enable Archive encryption switch.</str>
  <str key="saving_cfg_title">Saving configuration</str>
  <str key="saving_cfg_intro">If you prefer command-line interface (CLI) before graphical user interface (GUI), SaveDesktop in addition to saving configuration in the GUI, allows you save configuration in the CLI.</str>
  <str key="save_cfg_outro">When using this method, it uses parameters from the GUI, specifically parameters from the periodic saving mode, such as filename format and selected folder for periodic saving files. You can save the configuration with this method whenever you want, regardless of the selected periodic saving interval.</str>
  <str key="enc">The archive will be saved as a ZIP archive (because Tar doesn't support the password protection feature), and if you want to extract it, you will be asked to enter the password that you used in the saving configuration process. The same applies in the case of configuration import.

If you forgot the password, it will not possible to extract the archive and use it in the importing configuration process.</str>
